Rising fuel price and taxes add up to 5% rise in income tax for poorer families, says Tesco's UK boss|Tesco's UK chief executive, Richard Brasher, has claimed that the "inexorable rise of fuel prices", as well as other rising household costs, add up to a 5% rise in income tax for poorer families.<br/><br/>Filling up at the pumps, as well as higher utilities bills and taxes, is estimated to be costing households £12 more a week than last year and Brasher said the squeeze on disposable incomes was a "real challenge" for Tesco's customers. He said shoppers were now "paranoid about debt", with financial tips websites like Martin Lewis's Moneysavingexpert.com attracting a "biblical" following.<br/><br/>Brasher is Tesco's first dedicated UK chief executive and his comments were made at one of his first public appearances at the Retail Week conference in London.<br/><br/>Also speaking at the conference was Alliance Boots chief executive Andy Hornby, who predicted: "We are not going to see consumer spend growing in the next two years." Hornby joined the Boots the Chemist owner in 2009 just nine months after he left HBOS, the bank rescued by Lloyds in a government-brokered takeover.<br/><br/>Higher taxes as well as rising food and fuel prices are forcing consumers to change their shopping habits, but Brasher said consumers were not reacting in a uniform manner, with Tesco seeing both "trading up and trading down" in its stores. He said there was "no single soundbite" that described how consumers were reacting to straitened times.<br/><br/>The cautious comments were in keeping with a survey last week showing that UK retail sales in February fell at their fastest annual pace in 10 months. The chief executive of Debenhams, Rob Templeman, said consumers had pulled in their horns since the turn of the year: "The consumer mindset has changed. They're looking at what they need to have, not what they want to have."<br/>|51.70530,-0.02679|Minigame1;Minigame5;Minigame9
UK banks must be able to cope with double dip recession, FSA says|Britain's biggest banks are being told they must have enough capital to withstand a plunge back into recession in the next four years, the FSA said today as it also warned about the impact rising interest rates could have on thousands of mortgage customers.<br/><br/>The FSA devoted an entire chapter of its Prudential Risk Outlook to historically low interest rates – which have been at 0.5% for two years – and admits it is "too soon" to predict the scale of losses for insurers from the Japanese earthquake, which has followed on quickly from catastrophes in Australia and New Zealand. The losses, though, are likely to be "material" for insurers even before the US hurricane season later in the year. The FSA said UK banks have £136bn of exposure to Japan.<br/><br/>A day after Lord Turner, chairman of the soon-to-be-broken-up FSA, warned that banks should hold capital cushions of 20%, double their current levels, he set out priorities for banks and insurance companies in the years ahead. He highlighted the dangers of transferring risks from banks to other parts of the financial system and potential credit risks created by "vulnerable" eurozone countries.<br/><br/>Turner said: "In the face of these still important risks, it is vital that banks focus on achieving further progress to sound funding positions, maintain high capital ratios and adequate provisions, and that banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions focus strongly on the specific risks to which their business mix exposes them."<br/><br/>The new stress tests require banks to consider a peak-to-trough fall in gross domestic product of 4.3% between 2011 and 2015. In 2010, the test was for a peak-to-trough fall of 2.3% in the four years to 2014. The tests require banks to assume house price falls of 20% over the four years and unemployment peaking at 12.4%. This compares with the 23% fall in house prices and the 13.4% peak in unemployment that the 2010 stress tests considered.<br/><br/>The regulator also makes clear that banks should be considering the impact of interest rate changes on their financial position – and that of their customers, both households and companies. For mortgage customers, for instance, forbearance [flexibility to change the terms of the loan] might be disguising the scale of problems. "The picture may change, particularly when interest rates rise," the FSA said.<br/><br/>Towards commercial property – where more than 20% of outstanding UK loans are in breach of financial covenant or in default – forbearance is also keeping provisions low although the FSA noted write-offs are "almost certain to rise".<br/><br/>Turner used the risk update to warn banks which continue to target returns on equity of 12-15% that these targets may not be achievable. Banks need to be prudential about their dividend payments and bonus payouts. "The corollary of higher equity capital requirements, which will reduce the riskiness of banks, is that shareholders should be willing to accept lower returns on equity," the FSA said.<br/><br/>"Banks that seek to maintain unchanged return-on-equity targets will only be able to achieve these if they can increase return on risk-weighted assets, and may be tempted to do so by taking increased risk or by underestimating risk. Supervisors need to remain vigilant to ensure that banks do not take excessive risks in an attempt to maintain return on equity in this way.<br/><br/>"These points highlight the importance of taking a prudent approach towards dividend payout ratios and remuneration to conserve capital within firms."<br/><br/>The regulator also noted that two liquidity schemes run by the Bank of England, which are helping to keep the banking system afloat, have provided over £300bn of support, which equated to over 10% of the liabilities of the major UK banks. They will need to raise money in the wholesale markets again as savings from customers will not be large enough to plug this potential hole.<br/><br/>The stress tests for banks also require the imposition of worst-case scenarios for banks with exposures to eurozone economies such as Ireland and Spain. UK banks are most exposed to borrowers in Ireland and Spain, with much smaller exposures to Portugal and Greece. There are also risks caused by the indirect exposures of UK banks to German and French banks, which in turn have significant exposures to Spain and Portugal. At the end of the third quarter of 2010, UK banks' exposures to German and French banks was £150bn.<br/><br/>Of its stress tests for 2011, the FSA said: "The new scenario has a broadly similar shape to the 2010 scenario, with deterioration in the UK and global economies through 2011/12. UK residential and commercial property prices fall substantially, reaching a low point in 2012/13 before recovering. The UK unemployment rate peaks in 2013 before falling to under 8% by the end of the scenario."<br/><br/>The FSA is also asking banks to consider the impact of a restructuring of sovereign debt in the eurozone – something which other European regulators have not yet required.<br/><br/>The FSA also noted that there had been an increase in the number of mortgages being granted by lenders with a high loan-to-income ratio.<br/>|51.50531,-0.01969|Minigame3;Minigame2;Minigame7
